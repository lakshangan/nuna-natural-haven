🌿 Project Report: Renu's Natural Haven
Modern E-Commerce for Organic & Natural Wellness

1. Project Overview
Renu's Natural Haven is a high-end, responsive e-commerce platform dedicated to organic skincare and wellness products. The project focuses on a "Nature-First" aesthetic, combining premium UI design with a robust full-stack architecture to provide a seamless shopping experience.

2. Technical Stack
The project is built using a modern decoupled architecture (Frontend and Backend separated for scalability).

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Frontend | React (Vite + TS) | Fast, component-based UI with Type safety. |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | Utility-first styling for premium responsive design. |
| Animations | Framer Motion | Smooth transitions and micro-interactions. |
| Backend | Node.js + Express | Custom API for product logic and payment handling. |
| Database | Supabase (PostgreSQL) | Real-time database and secure data storage. |
| Authentication | Supabase Auth | Secure user login/signup and session management. |
| Payments | Stripe | Industry-standard secure payment processing. |

3. System Architecture
The application follows a Modular Client-Server Pattern.

Logic Flow:
- Frontend: Acts as the "Face" of the app, managing state (Cart, User) locally using React Context.
- Backend: Acts as the "Brain", securing sensitive operations like Stripe checkouts and fetching products from Supabase.
- Supabase: Acts as the "Memory", storing product details, user profiles, and images.

4. Core Logic & Features

Product Management:
- Dynamic Routing: Each product has a unique slug (e.g., /product/natural-glow-oil).
- API Integration: The backend fetches product data directly from Supabase tables to ensure the latest stock/price is always shown.

Shopping Cart System:
- Context API: Used to manage the cart globally. Users can add/remove items from any page without losing their selection.
- Persistence: Cart data is synced so users don't lose items on accidental refreshes.

Authentication Flow:
- Hybrid Security: Users sign up via Supabase Auth. This provides enterprise-grade security (JWT tokens) without the need for manual password hashing logic on the backend.

Checkout Logic:
1. User clicks "Checkout".
2. Backend creates a Stripe Session.
3. Backend triggers an Automated Email Confirmation via Resend API.
4. User is redirected to Stripe's secure portal.
5. On success, user returns to /checkout-success and the order is recorded.

5. Directory Structure

- src/: FRONTEND (The Visuals)
  - components/: Reusable UI (Buttons, Cards, Modals)
  - pages/: View logic (Shop, Ingredients, Auth)
  - contexts/: State management (Cart, Auth)
  - lib/: Utils (Supabase Client, Helpers)

- backend/: BACKEND (The Brain)
  - src/controllers/: Business logic (What happens when you click)
  - src/routes/: API Endpoints (/api/products)
  - src/config/: Secrets & Environment settings

- root/: Project configs (Tailwind, TS, Vite)

6. Design Philosophy
- Typography: Using clean, modern fonts (Inter/Outfit) for readability.
- Palate: Earthy tones (Greens, Creams, Soft Browns) to reflect the "Natural" brand.
- Glassmorphism: Subtle translucent backgrounds on cards to give a "premium/expensive" feel.
- Micro-animations: Elements slide or fade in as you scroll to keep the user engaged.

Summary:
This project is a production-ready e-commerce engine. It uses a scalable backend that can handle thousands of products and a frontend optimized for mobile-first users. By using Supabase and Stripe, we ensure that user data and money are handled with the highest level of security.
