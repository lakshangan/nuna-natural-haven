🌿 Project Report: Renu's Natural Haven
Modern E-Commerce for Organic & Natural Wellness

1. Project Overview
Renu's Natural Haven is a high-end, responsive e-commerce platform dedicated to organic skincare and wellness products. The project has evolved into a robust full-stack application with a "Nature-First" aesthetic, combining premium UI design with a secure, decoupled architecture.

2. Updated Technical Stack
The project now follows a professional decoupled architecture (Frontend and Backend separated), ensuring scalability and security.

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Frontend | React (Vite + TS) | Fast, component-based UI with strict type safety. |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | Utility-first styling for premium responsive design. |
| Animations | Framer Motion | Smooth transitions and luxurious micro-interactions. |
| Backend | Node.js + Express | Custom API serving as the middleware and logic layer. |
| Database | Supabase (PostgreSQL) | Managed database for product data and user profiles. |
| Auth | Supabase + Google | Secure multi-method authentication (Email & Google OAuth). |
| State | React Query | Server-state management for efficient data fetching/caching. |
| Analytics | Vercel Analytics | Real-time traffic and user behavior tracking. |
| Payments | Stripe | Industry-standard secure payment processing. |

3. Advanced System Architecture
The application has transitioned from a client-heavy model to a proper Client-Server-Database pattern.

Logic Flow:
- Frontend (Client): The visual interface. It no longer connects directly to Supabase for data (promoting security). It consumes the custom Backend API.
- Backend (API): The "Bridge" and "Security Guard". It handles all communications with Supabase, validates requests, and processes sensitive Stripe operations.
- Supabase (Store): Stores all persistent data securely, accessed only by the backend.

4. Key Features & New Changes

Branding & Identity:
- New Visual Identity: Integrated the "Nuna" brand identity with the implementation of `nunalogo.png` across the platform (Navbar, Footer, Auth pages).

Product System (API Driven):
- Backend Proxying: Switched from Supabase clients to RESTful API endpoints (/api/products).
- useProducts & useProduct Hooks: Implemented custom hooks for efficient data fetching with loading states and error handling.
- Dynamic Detail Pages: Deep-linking and product-specific renders via slug-based routing.

Admin Ecosystem:
- Admin Dashboard: A newly implemented administrative suite (/admin) for managing the store.
- Product Manager: Interface to add, edit, or remove products without touching the database code.
- Order & Customer Tracking: Dedicated views for monitoring business performance.

Security & Authentication:
- Google OAuth Integration: Users can now sign in using their Google accounts for a friction-less experience.
- Protected Routes: Admin areas are secured, ensuring only authorized personnel can access sensitive data.

Shopping Experience:
- Persisted Cart: Global state management using Context API ensures the cart remains intact during navigation.
- Stripe Checkout: Seamless transition from cart to secure payment, with automated confirmation logic.

5. Directory Structure

- src/: FRONTEND (The Visuals)
  - components/: Modular UI elements (Glassmorphic cards, premium buttons).
  - hooks/: Custom logic for API interaction (useProducts).
  - pages/: Core views (Shop, ProductDetail, Ingredients).
  - pages/admin/: Detailed admin sub-system.
  - contexts/: Global state (Cart, Auth).

- backend/: BACKEND (The Core)
  - src/routes/: Express routes for products, orders, and payments.
  - src/controllers/: Brain of the app (CRUD operations, Logic).
  - src/config/: Secure environment variables (Supabase Keys, Stripe Secrets).

6. Design Philosophy
- Neo-Brutalist Luxury: A mix of earthy tones (Greens, Creams) with bold typography and high-contrast elements.
- Premium Feel: Heavy use of glassmorphism, subtle gradients, and motion-blur transitions.
- Mobile Excellence: Fully responsive layouts optimized for touch interactions and smaller screens.

Summary:
The project is now a production-grade e-commerce engine. By moving database logic to the backend and introducing an admin suite, we've created a scalable system ready for real-world traffic. The addition of Google OAuth and the Nuna branding further polishes the professional identity of Renu's Natural Haven.
